# IamajavaOS

This is an experimental repo trying to utilise the ability of fedora silverblue  to boot into oci-compliant images. 
With `rpm-ostree rebase  ostree-unverified-image:docker://ghcr.io/iamjava/iamjavaos:39` you can rebase your silverblue to my OS built with the Containerfile in this repo.
Nice 
(Work in progress) (Yes, this might be nix with docker-tooling)
